// AMD FSR upscaling (FSR 3.1 and FSR 4) in place of OoT's gameplay upscale network (vk_ffx.cpp), through AMD's signed
// runtime for Vulkan (FSR SDK 2.4: amd_fidelityfx_loader_vk.dll and amd_fidelityfx_upscaler_vk.dll, fetched by
// scripts/ffx_sdk.py into the game folder's ffx folder). vk_dlss.cpp makes its inputs (the same as DLSS's: the scene's
// colour, depth and motion, the camera's jitter) and calls ffx::upscale where DLSS would evaluate.
// Windows only: AMD publishes the runtime for Windows alone. Elsewhere these say FSR is not there.
